# TT-Seek üöçüß†

TT-Seek is a smart transit optimization prototype built using the Gemini API, Python Flask, and Leaflet.js. This project visualizes real-time transit data on a map, estimates foot traffic around bus stops, and uses AI to suggest optimized bus scheduling ‚Äî including which stops to emphasize or avoid.

This project was developed during the MLH x SolutionHacks Hackathon (June 27‚Äì29, 2025).

The aim of this project is to assist with the UN's SDG goal #11: Sustainable Cities & Communities

## üîç Project Overview

The app simulates and analyzes transit flow by:
- Randomly generating commuter presence around TTC bus stops.
- Mapping this data into a heatmap-style visualization.
- Sending that compiled information to the Gemini API.
- Using AI analysis to determine:
  - Optimal number of buses to deploy
  - Ideal bus intervals
  - High-priority and low-priority bus stops

## üì¶ How to Run the Demo

1. Clone this repository on your machine using `git clone https://github.com/ArnavKothekar/TT-Seek_Project.git`
2. Install all of the required python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
4. Write your Gemini API key in the `.env` file as follows:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
6. Open `run.py` in your preferred Python IDE or compiler
7. Run the script

Once running, visit:

```bash
