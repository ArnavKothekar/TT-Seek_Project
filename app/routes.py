You are a transit optimization AI for Toronto's TTC network.

Below is CSV data of stops along Eglinton Avenue. Each row contains:
Stop Name, Latitude, Longitude, Direction (eastbound or westbound), and People Waiting.

Each bus has a maximum capacity of 40 people. Be sure to mention this in your recommendations.

Your task is to:
- Recommend how many buses should be sent **eastbound** and at what intervals (in minutes) and certain stops to emphasize and avoid based on the number of people waiting.
- Do the same for the **westbound** direction
- Provide 1 general suggestion on improving rider experience and congestion handling
- Conclude with a 2 sentence explanation about how this system supports **UN SDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**, with a positive and inspiring tone, try to focus on the impact of what it means to have a well-functioning transit system.

Make the entire answer around 4 points long, with each point being a single sentence. Title the sections "Eastbound Recommendations", "Westbound Recommendations", "General Suggestions", and "UN SDG #11: Sustainable Community Impact".
Please do not use markdown formatting but use emojis to make the response engaging.

Here is the data:
